What is JWt ?
------------

JWt is a Java library for developing web applications. It provides a pure
Java component-driven approach to building web applications,
and renders either using Ajax or plain HTML.

Unlike JSF, there is no concept of a page and no split between "views" 
and "components". Instead, everything is a widget.

"JWt homepage").

Dependencies
------------

The library requires a Servlet 2.5 or 3.0 container. When deployed in a
servlet 3.0 container, it is able to use asynchronous I/O functionality
to improve scalability when using server push features.

Building
--------

It can be as simple as:

    ant
