== Introduction

JWt is a Java library for developing web applications. The library
uses the standard Java Servlet infrastructure, and therefore, a JWt
web application may be deployed in existing servlet containers or
JEE web application servers.

The API is widget-centric, and inspired by existing Graphical User
Interface (GUI) APIs: a widget is a self-contained class which
encapsulates all event handling related to a user interface
element. To the developer, the library offers complete abstraction of
web-specific implementation details, including event handling and
graphics support, while keeping web semantics of URLs, bookmarks, and
forward/backword navigation and therefore also search engine
interopability.

== JWt: getting started

In this section, we will go through the steps to download and install
JWt, and deploy and run the examples that come bundled with it. We
will detail the procedure for the ubiquitious 'Hello world' example,
but you can follow the same steps for each of the examples.

[TIP]

The examples that come with the library are each a self-contained project
which only require the JWt library (and its dependencies) to get
going. You could structure your own projects in the same way as each
of these example projects, but it is up to you: the library does not
enforce a particular layout of your web application, it simply acts as
a library (rather than a 'framework').

We present two tracks for running your first JWt application: from
within the Eclipse IDE or from the command line. You will need to
download the JWt distribution which contains the library and its dependencies,
from the homepage's http://www.webtoolkit.eu/jwt#/download[download section].

=== 'Hello world' from within Eclipse

The library and all of the examples include a +.project+ file which is
used by Eclipse to manage the build process. For deploying the web
application during development, we recommend using the 'run-jetty-run'
plugin.

==== Requirements
To run the 'Hello world' example with Eclipse you will need to install the 
following softwares:

- Java Standard Edition Development Kit (version 5.0 or later) from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/
- Eclipse IDE (Java/JEE Edition 3.4.2 or later) from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
- run-jetty-run plugin (1.1.1 or later) from http://code.google.com/p/run-jetty-run/

==== Importing  into Eclipse

. Extract the JWt source distribution to a directory on your system.
. Start Eclipse.
. Right-click inside your 'Project Explorer' and select 'Import' -> 'Import...'.
. Select 'General' -> 'Existing Projects into Workspace' and click 'Next'.
. Click 'Browse'.
. Navigate to the directory where the JWt source distribution was extracted to.
  Select the +examples/hello+ directory and click 'OK'.
+
[TIP]
You can import multiple examples at once by selecting the +examples+
directory instead, and selecting multiple projects in the next step.
+
. The hello project will be visible and selected, click 'Finish'.
. The imported +jwt-hello+ project becomes visible in the 'Project
  Explorer' tree.
+
There are however still build errors as the JWt library and dependencies
are still missing.
+

+
. We have provided an ant build script that copies the JWt library and
dependencies in the +lib+ folder and also builds a 'war' file.
+
Right-click on the +build.xml+, 'Run As' -> 'Ant Build'.
When this is your first example, the build script will also build the
JWt library itself.
+
. 'Refresh' your jwt-hello project. The example is now built and ready to be
  run.

==== Running

Below, we use the 'run-jetty-run' plugin. You may also use any other
JEE application server (with integration in Eclipse) to which you
deploy the +dist/jwt-hello.war+ file which has also been
built by the ant tool.

. Open the 'Run' -> 'Run Configurations...' dialog.
. Create a new 'Jetty Webapp'.
+
Since this example does not require HTTPS, remove the HTTPS port value in the
'Ports' section. Removing this value will disable all other HTTPS related 
settings.
+ 
. Click on the 'Browse...' button in the 'Web Application' section and select
the 'WebRoot' folder.
+
. Click 'Run' (your configuration settings will be saved).
+
. The servlet container starts listening on port 8080
. Open your web browser and point it to +http://localhost:8080/+.

=== 'Hello World' on the command line with Ant 

To build the library and examples, we will be using _ant_, and for
deployemt we will use the light-weight _Jetty_ servlet container.

==== Requirements 
To run the 'Hello world' example from the command line you will need to
install the following softwares:

- Java Standard Edition Development Kit (version 5.0 or later) from 
  http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/
- Ant (version 1.7.1 or later) from
  http://ant.apache.org/
- Jetty (version 6.1.18 or later) from 
  http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/ (in the end, any servlet container or
  application server will do, these instructions however assume Jetty)

==== Building
- Open you command line console.
- Extract the JWt source distribution to a directory on your system, and 
  navigate to this directory.
- Enter the +examples/hello+ directory and run 'ant':
+
.....
$ cd examples/hello
$ ant
.....
+ 
This will build +dist/jwt-hello.war+, handling all of the dependencies
including JWt itself.

==== Running
- Copy the +jwt-hello.war+ to +jetty-install-dir/webapps/hello.war+.
- Start Jetty: 
  * On Unix: `jetty-install-dir/bin/jetty.sh start`
  * On Windows: `java -jar jetty-install-dir\start.jar`
- Open your preferred web browser and navigate to 
  http://localhost:8080/hello/.

=== A closer look at a JWt web application project structure

A JWt project is a setup does not involve much, since JWt acts as a
Java library (on top of the Java servlet API). After running 'ant' in
the JWt source distrubition folder, all required jar files can be
found in the +{jwt-src-path}/dist+ folder. To use JWt in your project,
you need only to include these 4 jar files into your project library
path.

The start point of your application is defined by extending
'WtServlet' which implements a Java servlet, and provides an entry
point to a JWt application. An example of this is
'eu.webtoolkit.jwt.examples.hello.HelloMain'.

To deploy the web application you need to provide a +WebRoot/web.xml+
configuration file which binds the servlet to a context path:
