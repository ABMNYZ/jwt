<h2><span>Category Chart</span></h2>

<p class="p">
  A category chart uses categories on the X axis, and displays one or
  more data series on the Y axes. The values corresponding to each
  category are plotted consecutively (this is the main difference with
  a ScatterPlot). Each data series corresponds to a column from the
  model.
</p>

<p class="p">
  A cartesian chart provides automatic configuration of the axes, and
  support for a second Y axis. In addition, you may use a simple
  built-in legend, or extend the class to provide a specialized
  legend.

<h2><span>Scatter Plot (time series)</span></h2>

<p class="p">
  A scatter plot is very much like a category chart, but uses
  numerical data on the X axis. By default, these numerical data are
  mapped linearly on the X axis, but may also be log transformed (as
  can be configured for the Y axes). In addition, there is special
  support for displaying date series, by means of smart heuristics for
  chosing the labels on the X axis.

<h2><span>Scatter Plot (sine function)</span></h2>

<p class="p">
  Below we plot a single sine curves. We use 'curve' data series,
  which creates a smooth spline curve that interpolates the data
  points. As is typical when showing mathematical functions, we let
  the axes cross each other at the origin (0, 0).

<h2><span>Pie chart</span></h2>

<p class="p">
  The pie chart is provided by the WPieChart widget. A pie chart can
  only display data from one data series. The class supports both
  plain 2D pies, as well as a 3D effect (as used below). As shown
  below for the first segment, these may be separated from the pie to
  show emphasis.
