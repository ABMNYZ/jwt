The example can be run like any other JWt example.
In order to use it, you will need  to setup a postgresql database.

This can be done by:
create user jwt password 'jwt';
create database jwtplanner owner jwt;

applying the schema found in planner/src/META-INF/schema.postgres

If you want to change database/user names, 
you will need to change the planner/src/META-INF/persistence.xml.
